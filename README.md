## The Scary Story - A Text Adventure

This is a text adventure which I made in python 3 and is also one of my first projects.

-------

## Installation:

Make sure you have python 3 installed.

#### Linux:

Open a terminal and copy and paste the commands below.

git clone https://github.com/atwoyearold14/The-Scary-Story.git && cd The-Scary-Story

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Then, run python3 main.py

If you die at any time run python3 main.py again and you will restart from the beginning.

#### Windows:

Download the zip file and extract it

Open up a command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file.

Run pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, you can run python main.py

If you die at any time run python main.py again and you will restart from the beginning.
