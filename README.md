The-Scary-Story---A-Text-Adventure

This is a text adventure which I made in python 3 and is also one of my first projects.

Installation

Make sure you have python 3 installed.

Linux:

Open a terminal and copy and paste the commands below.

git clone https://github.com/atwoyearold14/The-Scary-Story.git && cd The-Scary-Story
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Then, run python3 main.py
If you die at anytime run python3 main.py again and you will restart from the beginning.
